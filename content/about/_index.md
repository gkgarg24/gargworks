## Gaurav Garg

Software engineer based in Charlotte, NC. I've spent most of my career working on identity and authentication systems — the infrastructure that handles how users log in, stay secure, and get verified at scale.

Currently at Charter Communications (Spectrum), where I work on the platform that manages authentication for their customer base. Day-to-day that means writing Java and Go services, debugging production issues, and occasionally migrating large datasets without breaking things.

### What I work on

**Identity & Authentication** — Building and maintaining systems that handle login, multi-factor auth, passwordless (WebAuthn/FIDO2), and account lifecycle. This includes both the user-facing flows and the backend services that support them.

**Backend services** — Primarily Java (Spring Boot) and Go. I've worked on everything from high-throughput microservices to internal tooling and CLI utilities.

**Production reliability** — A fair amount of my time goes into diagnosing and fixing production problems: memory leaks, GC pressure, slow queries, thread contention. I find this kind of work genuinely interesting.

**Data migrations** — I've run several large-scale migrations, including moving customer records and authentication data across systems with strict zero-loss requirements.

### Background

I've been writing software professionally since 2003. Before Charter, I worked at Amtrak, Time Warner Cable, FedEx, and a few smaller companies. Earlier in my career I did some NLP work on an online question-answering system, which was an interesting detour.

B.E. Computer Science & Engineering — National Institute of Technology (1999–2003)
