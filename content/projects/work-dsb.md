The Directory Service Bus is a custom enterprise service bus that provides a central integration layer for identity management. It handles identities across customers, accounts, devices, services, and personalization data — all stored in a custom Enterprise Service Directory built on Ping Directory (previously Novell eDirectory), with over a billion objects.

DSB connects to downstream systems — phone, TV, and broadband provisioning, device management, and customer-facing portals — via JMS (Java Messaging Service) and HTTP, routing identity changes to the right consumers as they happen.
