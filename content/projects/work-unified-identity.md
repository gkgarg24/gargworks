A platform that manages the full lifecycle of customer identities — creation, updates, synchronization, and recovery. It's made up of several services that work together: a core identity service, a task server for async operations, a management portal for internal teams, and a sync service that keeps identity data consistent across systems.

Key aspects of the work: designing for failure recovery and data mirroring, building the admin portal for identity lifecycle management, and keeping the whole thing running reliably at scale.
