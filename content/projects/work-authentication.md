Authentication platform handling how customers log in — covering PIN, security questions, TOTP (Google Authenticator), and passwordless login via WebAuthn/FIDO2 biometrics. Built across two generations: an older multi-factor system (SLAUTH2) and a newer platform (SLAUTH3) on Java 21 and Spring Boot 3.

A significant part of the work involved migrating 11 million customer identities from an Oracle-based system to a Ping LDAP directory, including challenge/security question data, with no loss and minimal disruption.
